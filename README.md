# GraphQL Examples
These are some really basic GraphQL examples

## Getting started
You need node to exec the examples.  
To run the examples, exec in the terminal `node filename`  
Example: `node /initial/index.js`  

For all the examples, except the ones in `initial`, exec in the terminal `node filename` and open `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

## Order in chaos

1. Start in `/initial/index.js`
2. How to work with collections `/initial/video-collection.js`
3. Check how to use graphql and express `express/use-express-graphql.js`
4. How to write a schema with js `express/js-graphql-schema.js`
5. Query videos by specific ID using `args` in `express/query-by-id.js`
6. How to define required args with `GraphQLNonNull` in `express/non-null.js`
7. Return a collection of videos with `GraphQLList` in ``express/resolve-all-videos.js`
8. Mutations! Add a new video to the collection `mutations/mutation.js`
9. Input types, organize args in mutations: `mutations/input-type.js`
